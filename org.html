              <p>The GNU Project is a free software, mass collaboration project, announced on September 27, 1983,
              by Richard Stallman at MIT. Its aim is to give computer users freedom and control in their use of their computers
               and computing devices, by collaboratively developing and providing software that is based on the following
                freedom rights: users are free to run the software, share it (copy, distribute), study it and modify it.
                GNU software guarantees these freedom-rights legally (via its license),
               and is therefore free software; the use of the word "free" always being taken to refer to freedom.</p>
               <p>The Free Software Foundation (FSF) is a non-profit organization founded
               to support the free software movement, which promotes the universal freedom to study, distribute, create,
                and modify computer software, with the organization's preference for software being
                distributed under copyleft ("share alike") terms, such as with its own GNU General Public License.
              FSF's funds were mostly used to employ software developers to write free software for the GNU Project.</p>
              <p>GNU is adopted as the core component of every Linux system</p>
